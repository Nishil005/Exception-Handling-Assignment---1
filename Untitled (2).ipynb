    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "An exception in Python is a mistake that happens while a programme is being run. It is a method of dealing with unanticipated or exceptional circumstances that may interfere with the regular course of code execution. When an exception occurs, the program's usual operation is interrupted, and control is passed to a specific section of code known as an exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, syntax mistakes in Python are a separate kind of error. They happen when the code disobeys the language's syntax and structural rules. Before the code is executed, the Python interpreter often finds syntax mistakes during the parsing process. Missing colons, mismatched brackets, and improper function call syntax are a few examples of syntax problems."

    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, the programme terminates in an unexpected way. In Python, printing a traceback message that includes details on the exception type, the line of code where it happened, and the call stack at the time of the exception is the default behaviour. The programme ends after printing the traceback, and any unfinished code is not run."
